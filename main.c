 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//   MSP430x24x Demo - USCI_A0, UART 9600 Full-Duplex Transceiver, 32kHz ACLK
//
//   Description: USCI_A0 communicates continously as fast as possible full-
//   duplex with another device. Normal mode is LPM3, with activity only during
//   RX and TX ISR's. The TX ISR indicates the USCI_A0 is ready to send another
//   character. The RX ISR indicates the USCI_A0 has received a character. At
//   9600 baud, a full character is tranceived ~1ms.
//   The levels on P1.4/5 are TX'ed. RX'ed value is displayed on P1.0/1.
//   ACLK = BRCLK = LFXT1 = 32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = DCO ~1.045Mhz
//   Baud rate divider with 32768Hz XTAL @9600 = 32768Hz/9600 = 3.41
//   //* An external watch crystal is required on XIN XOUT for ACLK *//
